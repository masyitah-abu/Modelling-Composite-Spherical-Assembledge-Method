# Modelling-Composite-Spherical-Assembledge-Method

-This work, is analyses a heterogeneous materialsâ€™ mechanical behaviour by using composite sphere model for Determination of :- 
  - Effective bulk (K) 
  - Poisson (v)
  - Shear modulus (U) 
  - Elastic modulus (E) 
  -
- For the experiment, the experimental value of k1 and E1, and those of the aggregated values of k2 and E2 are chosen by the user. 
- The input of k1, k2, E1 and E2 are in Gpa units.
